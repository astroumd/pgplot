# We set PGPLOT_DIR to the directory containing
# pgxwin_server, because the X driver only consults
# that environment variable. This modifies the 
# semantics of the variable somewhat; it is normally
# supposed to just point to the general directory where
# pgplot files live. In our more enlightened,
# autoconf-ized world, this interpretation is deprecated.
